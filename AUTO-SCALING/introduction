this is auto scaling ?
*************************************
uto Scaling is a feature that automatically adjusts the number of servers based on demand.

Imagine you have a website, and suddenly, many people start visiting it.
Auto Scaling adds more servers to handle the traffic. When traffic decreases, it removes extra servers to save costs.

Itâ€™s like a restaurant hiring more chefs when customers increase and reducing staff when it's less busy,
ensuring smooth service without wasting resources.
