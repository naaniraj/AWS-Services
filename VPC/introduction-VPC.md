âœ… 1. Subnets 

subet is like a isolated space in our vpc to keep the data inside of it

  1 . Public Subnet â€“ connected to the internet.
      we can cannact , and access the services that inside

  2 . Private Subnet â€“ isolated from the internet.
       we cant acces from outside ,we keep user sensitive information herelike a data-base
       
âœ… 2. Internet Gateway (IGW)

Allows communication between  VPC and the internet.

Required for public subnets to access the internet.

âœ… 3. NAT Gateway / NAT Instance

Lets instances in private subnets access the internet (for updates, etc.) without exposing them directly.

NAT Gateway is a managed service, NAT Instance is a manually configured EC2.

âœ… 4. Route Tables

Define how traffic is directed in your VPC.Each subnet must be associated with a route table.

âœ… 5. Security Groups

Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.Control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

âœ… 6. Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)

Firewall at the subnet level.Provide an extra layer of security with stateless traffic filtering.

âœ… 7. VPC Peering

Allows communication between two VPCs (in the same or different accounts) using private IP addresses.

âœ… 8. Elastic IP

Static public IP you can attach to an EC2 instance in your VPC.

âœ… 9. Endpoints (Interface & Gateway)

Allow private connections from your VPC to AWS services without needing a NAT or IGW.

âœ… 10. DHCP Option Sets

Controls DNS resolution within your VPC.

âœ… 11. Carrier Gateway / Transit Gateway

Carrier Gateway â€“ used for AWS Wavelength.
Transit Gateway â€“ connects multiple VPCs and on-prem networks via a central hub.
