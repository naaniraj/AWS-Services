## ⚖️ What is Load Balancer ?
***********************************
Load balancer is destubute the traffic between all the  servers evenly ,

load balancer use several statagys to reduce in comming traffic  to minimize 

to destribute traffice among the all servers to reduce the in comming trafice.

## Types OF  Load Balancer ?
1️⃣ Clssic Load Balancer :-
Its a tredestnal Load Balancer and old one 
we use this for simple applications , 

2️⃣ Application Load Balancer :-

3️⃣ Network Load Balancer :-

4️⃣ Gate way Load Balancer :-

## ⚖️❤️  Eenifits of Load-Balancer :-
*************************************
'***1 . Ensure High Avalabulity and Reliability***' :-<br>
Load Balancer Destribute incomming traffic across multiple servers ,<br>
it's help's to prevent downtime due to server failure and improves the overall relibility of your application .<br>

'***2 . Scalability***' :-<br>
Load Balancer enable horizontal scaling by Seamessly adding or removing servers based on traffic demands ,<br>
this elasticity allows your application to handle incresed user load without seacrificing perfamence .<br>

'***3 . Redundancy***' :-<br>
Load Balncer provide redundancy by routing traffic to multiple servers.<br>
if one server fail's ,the Load Balncer automatically redirect traffic to helthy servers,<br>
ninimizing the impact on users andmaintaining continous server avalabulity.<br>

'***4 . Geographic Destribution***' :-<br>
Load Balncer can destribute trafic across mutiple data senters or regions ,enabling geographic redundancy,<br>
By placing servers closer to your users , you canreduce letency and improve response time times .<br>
