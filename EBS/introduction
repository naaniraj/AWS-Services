What is EBS ?
***************************
EBS (Elastic Block Store) is like a hard drive in the cloud that you can attach to AWS servers (EC2 instances).

Just like a USB drive or an external hard disk, EBS stores data permanently, even if the server is turned off or restarted.

It is used to store databases, files, and application data and can be increased in size whenever needed.
