What is CI-CD ?
************************************
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It is a process that helps developers build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

Breaking it down:
ðŸ”¹ CI (Continuous Integration): Whenever a developer writes new code, it is automatically tested and merged with the existing code to make sure everything works properly.
ðŸ”¹ CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery): Once the code is tested and approved, it is automatically deployed to the live application (Continuous Deployment) or made ready for release with a manual step (Continuous Delivery).

Example:
Think of CI/CD like a fast food kitchen:

CI: Every time an order (code change) comes in, ingredients (code) are checked and combined properly.
CD: Once the food is ready and checked, it's either served automatically (Continuous Deployment) or kept ready for serving (Continuous Delivery).
This process helps companies release updates quickly without breaking the app! ðŸš€
