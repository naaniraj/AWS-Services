CloudWatch is a monitoring service from AWS that helps you track and analyze the performance of your applications, servers, and cloud resources.

It works by collecting data like CPU usage, memory, network activity, and errors, then showing you real-time graphs and sending alerts if something goes wrong.

Think of it like a security camera for your cloud systemsâ€”it watches everything, records important details, and alerts you if something needs attention. ðŸš€
