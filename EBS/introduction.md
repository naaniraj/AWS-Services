 ## What is EBS ?
***************************
EBS (Elastic Block Store) is like a hard drive in the cloud that you can attach to AWS servers (EC2 instances).
Just like a USB drive or an external hard disk, EBS stores data permanently, even if the server is turned off or restarted.
It is used to store databases, files, and application data and can be increased in size whenever needed.

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. 
It's like a virtual hard drive that you can attach to your cloud servers.
It's durable, high-performing, and you can scale it to meet your storage needs. 
Great for databases, file systems, and applications, 

EBS offers different volume types optimized for performance or throughput, depending on your needs.
You can create point-in-time snapshots for backups, encrypt data for security,
and even use Multi-Attach for shared access across instances. It's like having a versatile, reliable storage companion.
